UnlockScreenSaver
=================

Shell Script to allow an admin to unlock a non admin user screensaver locked console.

This script will change the /private/etc/pam.d/screensaver file to allow the admin user to unlock the console when locked by the screensaver. Essentially bringing back the old 10.6 and older behaviour.
